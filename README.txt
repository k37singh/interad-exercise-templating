Used AngularJs framework to create the responsive javascript. 
I would have preferred to use JQuery library in this particular instance but Gord mentioned I should show I am comfortable using Angular.
There is not quite as much angular used to show off particularly but I am familiar with other angular features like directives, filters, Event Handlers and such.

I did not use any CSS frameworks to complete the assignment. 
I did run into some issues with the design layout. 
I would have wished to debug throughly and make my CSS code more concise.
One particular issue I found interesting was the first four input fields that could be seen as rows but were supposed to be columns of two fields.
I used flexbox to tackle this and was happy with the results.
I did make a mistake which I realized later is that I should have created the CSS layout for mobile first. I shall keep that in mind next time.

I had never had any experience working with psd design templates so that was a fun experience.

To create the custom checkboxes I made use of images from the psd file.
I hope that is not considered a shortcut.

I did not have access to a Mac machine so I was not able to test in Safari browser. But judging from the emulator I ran it through it should look fine.

Other than this I cannot think of much to mention as the assignment was fairly straightforward. 
I tried to stick to the design spec as much as possible.
I hope you are happy with my effort.
